1)Create cv-Application repo on github 
2)Create UI for the General info 
    background light blue color
    create form cards with sideline
3)Add functionality for UI 


How things will work? 
    User will start at form where he/she will enter general info. 
    When user submits the form. The form will be hidden and new component -similar to A4 size page 
    - will display all the info
    User will have two button one to download the page in pdf form and other button to reset the whole thing. 
     
Update on how things will actually work

I all I have to do is to data stored in app.js state to cv.js and diaplay it.

=>Implement dstructing not working 
=> pass props as object which than should be destructured

Create Ui to display the cv data
